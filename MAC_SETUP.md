# 🖥️ Mac Desktop Shortcut Setup

This guide shows you how to create a desktop shortcut on your MacBook that will SSH into your Raspberry Pi and start the Smart Garden presentation system.

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### Step 1: Find Your Pi's IP Address
On your Raspberry Pi, run:
```bash
hostname -I
```
This will show your Pi's IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)

### Step 2: Run the Setup Script
On your Raspberry Pi, run:
```bash
./setup_mac_shortcut.sh
```
This will ask for your Pi's IP address and create the Mac application.

### Step 3: Copy to Your Mac
1. Copy the `SmartGardenStarter.app` folder to your Mac
2. You can use SCP, USB drive, or any file transfer method
3. Drag it to your Desktop or Applications folder

### Step 4: Use Your Shortcut
1. Double-click `SmartGardenStarter.app` on your Mac
2. It will open Terminal and SSH into your Pi
3. Start the Smart Garden system automatically
4. Open browser to: `http://YOUR_PI_IP:3000/presentation`

## 🎯 Alternative Methods

### Method 1: Simple Shell Script
Create a file called `start_smart_garden.sh` on your Mac:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
PI_IP="192.168.1.100"  # Replace with your Pi's IP
ssh pi@$PI_IP 'cd /home/pi/smart-garden-backend-master && ./quick_start.sh'
```

Make it executable and double-click to run.

### Method 2: AppleScript
Create a file called `Smart Garden Starter.scpt`:

```applescript
tell application "Terminal"
    activate
    do script "ssh pi@192.168.1.100 'cd /home/pi/smart-garden-backend-master && ./quick_start.sh'"
end tell
```

Double-click to run.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### SSH Key Setup (Recommended)
To avoid entering passwords every time:

1. **Generate SSH key on Mac:**
```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
```

2. **Copy key to Pi:**
```bash
ssh-copy-id pi@YOUR_PI_IP
```

3. **Test connection:**
```bash
ssh pi@YOUR_PI_IP
```

### Common Issues

**"Permission denied":**
- Make sure SSH is enabled on your Pi
- Check username and IP address
- Try SSH key authentication

**"Connection refused":**
- Check if Pi is powered on
- Verify IP address is correct
- Ensure both devices are on same network

**"Command not found":**
- Make sure the project is in the correct directory
- Check if `quick_start.sh` is executable

## 🎉 Perfect for Presentations!

Once set up, you can:
1. **Double-click** the desktop shortcut
2. **Wait 30 seconds** for system to start
3. **Open browser** to the presentation URL
